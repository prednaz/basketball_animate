* "#player1" instead of 1. or even {player: 1,...}
* more declerative by using lists
* get rid of implicit state of player_possession at compile time
* translation does not take an interim_result_target anymore
but the library_basketball contains a wrapper function which does and
translation_interim_result_target is moved there too.
* newlines
* new library versions
gsap workaround might not be needed anymore
